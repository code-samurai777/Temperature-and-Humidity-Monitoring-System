# Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitoring-System
Simulated Arduino-based temperature &amp; humidity monitoring system on Tinkercad using two potentiometers as a replacement of DHT11 sensor and data smoothing filter.

# Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System (Simulation)

This project simulates an Arduino-based instrumentation system that measures and displays temperature and humidity using a TMP36 sensor and two potentiometers and LCD. A moving average filter is applied to smooth noisy data, and readings are visualized manually in Excel.

## üîß Components Used
- Arduino UNO (simulated)
- TMP36 Temperature sensor
- Potentiometer (x2)
- 16x2 LCD Display
- 1k and 10k resistors
- Push button
- Jumper Wires  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Real-time measurement and display of temperature & humidity
- Moving Average filtering for noise reduction
- Dual visualization: Serial Plotter + Excel manual plot
- Fully simulated using Tinkercad

## üß† Technical Highlights
- Data acquisition and signal conditioning (filtering)
- Instrumentation-level measurement accuracy
- Simulation of real-world embedded system behavior
