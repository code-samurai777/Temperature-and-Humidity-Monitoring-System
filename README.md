## Project Overview
**Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System** is an Arduino-based project designed to measure and display temperature and humidity in real-time. A moving average filter is applied to smooth out the sensor noise, and data is visualized manually in Excel for further analysis.  
*Short description:* An Arduino-based temperature and humidity monitoring system with data filtering and visualization.

## Features
- Real-time measurement and display of temperature (Â°C) and humidity (%)  
- Moving Average filtering to smooth sensor noise  
- Visual output on 16x2 LCD and serial monitor  
- Manual plotting of data for analysis  
- Fully simulated using Tinkercad

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO (simulated)
- TMP36 Temperature sensor
- Potentiometer (x2)
- 16x2 LCD Display
- 1k and 10k resistors
- Push button
- Jumper Wires

## Code Explanation
**Main Arduino Code (`tinkercad_code.ino`):**  
- First potentiometer is used at lcd pin V0 for output
- Second potentiometer is used at arduino pin A1 to measure humidity.
- Implements a **Moving Average Filter** to reduce noise  
- Prints filtered values to serial monitor  
- Displays temperature & humidity on 16x2 LCD
  
---

## How It Works

 - Arduino reads sensor values from potentiometer every 2 seconds
 - Moving Average filter calculates smoothed readings
 - Filtered values displayed on LCD and serial monitor
 - Data recorded manually for Excel plotting
